Brands surround us. They pre-structure the meanings of actions we take. They advertise, sponsor, question, conquer; everything from toilet paper to life insurance; brands are but just a congealed blob of cells in the human brain which categorize them into mental schemas and “brand associations”, and elusive primordial imagery which speaks to our being. They are abstract concepts neatly contained and controlled within economic logics and some kind of reason to be here: commodities with ensuing “social lives” (Mitchell, 4). They are what we consider as “products”, the result of collective value creation, where a unique set of social practices, organizations of labour, and relations of production shape supply and demand to determine the dollar amount on a price tag. 

The past decade has been marked by an interesting phenomenon: an increase in firms who specialize in media production and use digital technologies as a means of charging and providing to customers. My limited examples span a diverse range of classifications of labour: musicians (Jay Z and Tidal), television networks (Showcase, Netflix, Disney, Hulu, the streaming industry) and studios (A24), radio transmission (Joe Rogan) and the podcast explosion. Everyone wants to start a streaming TV channel, streaming music, stream a show, streaming anything short of clean water.The data flow is widening. 5G networks plan to introduce speeds as quick as 20GB a second in some places while riverbanks dry up or flood.

 James Bridle’s essay focuses on automated content creation aimed at a child audience. But what kind of content would be produced by an AI if the objective was to connect with an older audience? And more importantly, what does it take to really make that distinction? Perhaps, a new form of media literacy to develop is the capacity to tell human media apart from computer media, media developed by algorithms and neural networks that you’re fed to sandwiched inside an aggregate of data; a sinister psy-op, a reflection on the stylistic fascinations of The Matrix  where life imitates art. Commercials and music and TV is made to be exactly what you want to hear: right… I mean, how far off from that are we?
