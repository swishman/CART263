    <h1> Constructing the Computer Personality </h1>

    <h3>What I’ve done is create “computer personalities” — or rather, appearances of such — in order to get us thinking about personhood, “auto”-nomy, and the abilities of machines to “think” for “themselves”.</h3>

    <p>James Bridle’s essay brings our attention to realize something which is pretty trippy: a lot of the content we find on Youtube is generated by artificial intelligence. Now, this concept has been seen before in the works of AI-generated paintings, music; there are plenty of examples of that on the web. Some of it is actually pretty good! In this process of assessing the quality and merit of audiovisual content generated by AI, I think it’s important to realize that data scientists feed these neural networks with learning material (audio, video, text) to produce some kind of digital consciousness, and the content that results is not the product of creative human thought, but creative computer “thought”. It results from big data and numbers crunched by a “neural network”, ideas produced through and from “machine learning”: a computational, artificial intelligence.
</p>
<p>
    Now, humans are not much different: much of the way we navigate through the world is influenced by what we see on television, or listen to on Spotify, or talk about with our friends. Indeed, our thoughts and beliefs on things are ultimately structured by our ability to digest our environments, our data, which we use to draw conclusions. That being said, different people draw different conclusions based on the different lives they experience — would the same be true for AI?
</p>
<p>
    The situation is (seemingly?) innocuous in the case of AI’s capacity to “draw conclusions” in order to generate children’s programming on Youtube — beyond the fact, of course, that we bombard children with marketing messages. But what about, for example, the racial biases that we’ve identified in surveillance and facial recognition technology? Would it make sense to call these machines “racist”, in such an example? These neural networks learn from what humans teach it: what information are we feeding them? What does the idea of “media literacy” mean for the “computer mind”? Does artificial intelligence have the ability of meta-cognition? Is there any conception of personhood when it comes to neural networks? And most importantly, how does AI serve to either reinforce, or challenge relations of production and power dynamics in society?
