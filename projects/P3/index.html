            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

        <h1>  Embeddedness </h1>
 Design Authority’s body of work examines ideas of embeddedness. Our artistic pursuits inspire a look “inward”: assessing the state of the world through an analysis of the gaze of both self and other.

a self-reflexive exercise in which we consider knowledgeable bounds of vision in relation to our cultures, and how this lends to further in analysis as we formate an idea of the other. We rely on this to develop creative works which express a respectable, compassionate and expanded comprehension of the diversity of cultural participation.

An expansion on Anamorphosis which distinguish self and other; cultural camouflage. </p>

</p>
<h1> Bricolage </h1>
Our postmodern reality details a specific and extensive exchange between individuals of all social, racial, sexual and religious backgrounds. This ultimately takes form as whole webs of knowledge trading across and potentially transgressing cultural bounds; in the visual arts, we use bricolage to describe the diverse range of elements for potential use in creative production, and the social dynamics which surround and construct cultural exchange.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
