This exercise was about futility, Sisyphus, rolling a rock up for all eternity. It’s about repetition as much as it’s about destiny: doing the same thing over and over again. And it’s especially about uselessness: you are powerless to do anything about it. Nihilism: that could be one way to perceive the late stage capitalist society I live in. I do find logic in looking at life through a lens informed by eastern philosophy (see Bryson on Nishitani, 1988).I looked at some of the other students’ projects and 2 or 3 of the first couple were games and web interactions focused on not having enough food to feed their family, or enough money to pay for living. We go to work, pay bills and die: That’s what you believe in when you believe in futility. Is life meaningless? I don't know if I can accept that, I don't want to believe that. 

Let’s consider the “futile” computer interaction: it is visual and audible. It is not logic-driven media. There’s no conception of good or bad design, a GUI, or navigation bars, or back buttons. It accomplishes something, but we might not be sure what it is. And it all has the capacity to be very beautiful.  

We gain control of common web media with JQuery, these web media essentially remediations of remediations, themselves forms of communication existing long before digital media: web pages are book pages, <p> tags are writing, our folder of JPEGs, or photos of our loved ones on the mantel; the songs we sing recorded onto bits and bytes, stored in the immaterial. These common web media are the pictures we look at and the text we read, the videos we watch, ultimately all just DOM objects within a digital dimension. They are now as suggestive in as many ways as they can be animated through JQuery: to be manipulated, coloured, turned into a story and brought to life… as web data. Our common web media are fundamentally called into question, and so this project was to consider interactions in ways which may seem strange or unexpected to the user, by grabbing control of their clicks, and their scrolls, and their mouse movements and keyboards, bringing the attention to the conventions which shape the way we use browsers to surf the Web. (Why not surf the Wave?…lol, what does that even mean?). We can on.click() or on.scroll() everything about a webpage. 

This exploration for me was different from my past projects in CART 253. Looking back, practicing with P5 was like jumping into really cold water: I got the shock in early, and now I’m very comfortable working with Javascript and JQuery to manipulate html and css.  It was a chance for me to learn how to use web technologies to create digital media in a way I am not accustomed to, by bringing what little knowledge I have of writing computer language to the next level. Markup HTML and CSS can do a lot of things nowadays, but the degree of interaction that users can attain is minimal compared to coding in JQuery.
